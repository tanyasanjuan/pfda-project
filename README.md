## 📜 Project Introduction
This project consists in analysing the wind speed in Dublin using synoptic station in Dublin_Airport, Co Dublin csv. The study aims to evaluate multivariate relationships among wind speed, temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, and humidity using statistical and visual analytical methods, and to assess how these variables have evolved over time, specifically over the last 3 decades. The research seeks to provide evidence-based insights into potential climate change.


## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this research is to analyze historical climate data through comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory analysis in order to identify temporal trends, seasonal patterns, and extreme events in wind speed and other key climatic variables to provide evidence-based insights into potential climate change.

## 🌬 Conclusions
Dublin's climate is changing. Temperature is rising 0.20°C per decade, humidity is dropping, and wind speeds are declining. Together, this points to climate change affecting Dublin's weather.

Temperature warming is the strongest signal. It matches global patterns. The humidity decrease also fits with warming.

Wind speed decrease might be climate change.
