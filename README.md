## 📜 Project Introduction
This project consists in analysing the wind speed around Ireland, using Met Eireann (Historical Data - Met Éireann - The Irish Meteorological Service)

This project consists of exploring and visualizing the analysis of the wind speed around Ireland, over the last 3 decades and how this data may be related to climate change.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This repository is organized in:

README.md
analysis.py
wind.csv
visualization of the data in format png.
summary.txt

## 🎯 Objective
Load the dataset.
Data Preparation and Cleaning. 
Handling of Missing Values. 
Temporal Aggregation - Daily - Monthly - Annual - Decade
Creation of Derived Variables; Year, Month, Season; Wind Operating Ranges
Perform a exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualize the data in format png.
Findings on wind: 
◽ Annual evolution of average wind speed. Comparison between decades.
◽ Increase, decrease, or stability of wind? 
◽ Changes in strong winds. 
◽ Prolonged periods of low wind. 
◽ Extreme Events and Climate Change. 
◽ Frequency of storms. 
◽ Evidence (or not) of climate change in wind resources.

## 💻 Program structure
Import libraries needed.
Import dataset and read the dataset.
Clean dataset.
Rename columns for easier reading.
Display general information of the dataset.
Dimension of the dataframe: How many columns and rows the dataset contains.
Display the mean, std, min, max and median for each feature.
Import matplotlib
Histogram of each characteristic.
